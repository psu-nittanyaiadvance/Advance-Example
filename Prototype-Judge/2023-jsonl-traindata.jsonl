Many hearing aids largely work well on a situation-by-situation basis where one can identify sounds of interest. The reality is, sound conveys a lot of information, and doesn\\'t tap us on the shoulder before reaching our ears. Responding quickly to sudden sounds can be crucial, especially in dangerous situations. Hearing aids and cochlear implants give access to sound, but situational awareness gives access to understanding. Understanding can be the di\ufb00erence between life and death, and the reason why someone feels present and/or safe in a situation. Understanding can take many forms, one of which is spatial and situational awareness. Individuals in the DHH (Deaf or Hard of Hearing) community have di\ufb00erent levels of hearing impairment. Even in situations where deafness impacts only one ear, a lack of awareness with directionality can make a huge di\ufb00erence when it comes to dealing with tra\ufb03c. Individuals with hearing impairments are fundamentally much more prone to accidents as a driver or a pedestrian. Some argue our vision, if used correctly, oftentimes enables us to make decisions that hearing impairments might have blinded us from. Still, however, there are countless situations where sound is the only source of information we have. A \ufb01re alarm, the dog barking outside, a baby crying in another room and a public announcement are all examples of factors that contribute to situational awareness. These factors enable humans to take action accordingly and avert dangerous situations. Aside from danger, feeling present in situations is equally as important. WICHE estimates that \\\"there are over 5 million deaf individuals in the United States who need mental health treatment every year. Only about 2% of these deaf individuals receive appropriate treatment for mental illness due to barriers in the e\ufb00ective diagnosis of mental illness. The prevalence of adults with serious mental illnesses (SMI) and children with serious emotional disturbances (SED) is likely greater in the deaf population than in the hearing population, sometimes estimated to be 3 to 5 times greater.\\\" While most DHH individuals are excellent lip-readers and can communicate with ASL easily, this requires their direct attention. Large meetings and group gatherings are only one of the many examples where being able to hear multiple people is di\ufb03cult. Informally, people do not usually signal before they speak, and in professional settings, even if a translator is obtained, rapid translation of mixed conversations is not an easy task. A spatial awareness application which accounts for real-life scenarios like these can be incredibly empowering for people within the DHH community by giving them their independence. This is exactly what the goal of Earality is. Project Overview Proposed Solution Earality seeks to augment the reality of DHH individuals with spatial and situational awareness. As an AR application, Earality accomplishes this by providing visual cues for sounds that are detected and classi\ufb01ed in three dimensions using normalized spherical coordinates. Our application is also polyphonic by nature and responds to moving audio inputs in real time. In other words, Earality emulates the way we humans hear sounds by detecting multiple sounds at once, all from di\ufb00erent directions, while simultaneously updating the location of sounds as their directionality changes in the listener\\'s environment. Because our mission is to empower DHH individuals by giving them their independence, this also means that Earality seeks to be an all-purpose application. This means not requiring users to carry di\ufb00erent devices and resources for every sound medium that they need assistance with. Earality aims to support general sound awareness, speech to text, as well as music which is powered by HapticBeat, the concept presented during the idea phase of the challenge. Use Case and Features The use cases of Earality are fairly straightforward. This application will be a daily-use service that is ready to provide visual cues for any sounds that are presented in the user\\'s environment. The interface will be minimalistic such that the cues do not interfere with the daily life and actions of users. Behind the scenes, the interface will consist of a spherical canvas around the user upon which color-coded pulses alongside text will share information about sounds in the user\\'s environment. For sounds that are not coming from the \ufb01eld-of-view of the user, there will be indicators showing whether there is a sound coming from the back left or right. The class of sounds will always be displayed as text in the front-view of the headset and not with the pulse to ensure users know what the sound source is, even if it is coming from behind them. Furthermore, Earality introduces the concept of residue, which is how we show where sounds come from seconds after they have already stopped being heard. When a color-coded pulse is given on the spherical canvas, that area will fade that color out over a certain period of time to ensure the user can see the directionality of the sound if it was not in their \ufb01eld-of-view. Additionally, there are two types of inputs that are categorized as di\ufb00erent from general sounds: speech and public announcements. Earality will store information on the past 10 seconds of sound in the case there is a discernible speech or public announcement detected. For a short time, after speech/PA is detected, the user will be able to opt-in to text generation which will then rewind Earality to the initial detection of the public announcement and display the associated text, or start text generation from the moment itself if it is speech. Current Work Thus far, our team has accomplished and is working on the more challenging components of Earality. We are able to depict sound classi\ufb01cation and localization in a three-dimensional format, both to demonstrate accuracy as well as a prototype for our AR application. Earality can currently detect up to 14 classes of sounds including speech which are: alarm, crying baby, crash, barking dog, running engine, female scream, female speech, burning \ufb01re, footsteps, knocking on door, male scream, male speech, ringing phone and music. Earality is polyphonic for up to 2 sounds, meaning we can con\ufb01dently detect and classify up to two sounds which are being played simultaneously. Earality can also detect and display the movement of sounds throughout the 3D space which is also crucial. We have tested some instances of the residue concept mentioned in the previous section, and it is still being worked on. Earality can successfully process any audio, primarily wav \ufb01les, and output the sound localization/detection information. For real-time, there is noticeable latency that we seek to minimize come the MVP phase. Technology Application of AI Earality processes input audio using a modi\ufb01ed version of the SELDnet baseline algorithm, which was featured in the 2020 edition of the DCASE (Detection and Classi\ufb01cation of Acoustic Scenes and Events) challenge. The SELDnet (Sound Event Localization and Detection network) described here is a sophisticated architecture that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to perform two critical tasks: detecting the presence of sound events and pinpointing their direction of arrival (DOA). To accomplish this, SELDnet takes in a spectrogram as input - a time-frequency representation of an audio signal that captures frequency content over time. The input spectrogram is then fed through multiple layers of CNNs that extract valuable features from the data and learn local patterns. Next, the RNN layers come into play, capturing the temporal dependencies in the data and helping the network understand how sound events change over time. Figure 1: SELDnet The output of the RNN layers divides into two parallel branches, each consisting of a dense layer followed by a \ufb01nal output layer. The Sound Event Detection (SED) branch determines the presence or absence of various sound events in the audio signal, while the Direction of Arrival (DOA) branch estimates the direction of arrival for the detected sound events. The output layers for each branch use di\ufb00erent activation functions; the SED branch utilizes a sigmoid activation function that generates probabilities for the presence of each sound event, and the DOA branch uses a linear activation function that provides continuous values representing the estimated DOAs. Finally, the outputs from the two branches are combined, resulting in a comprehensive list of detected sound events along with their corresponding DOAs. Overall, the SELDnet architecture is a robust and e\ufb00ective approach to sound event  localization and detection. The modi\ufb01ed version of SELDnet employs the same event-independent network, however when polyphonic sounds are to be detected and classi\ufb01ed it is thought of as a multiple-track problem. Each track is limited to one event and its corresponding direction-of-arrival (DoA). Instead of relying only on SED and DoA, the network generates three types of output predictions: SED, DoA and event activity detection (EAD). EAD predicts the on-set and o\ufb00-set times of events more accurately by encompassing feature embedding information from both SED and DoA. This enables the modi\ufb01ed version of SELDnet to substantially improve on accuracy. Data Sources This featured version of SELDnet from DCASE was pretrained on the TAU-NIGENS Spatial Sound Events 2020 dataset and was retrained with slight adjustments. This dataset showcases a wide range of spatial sound-scene recordings, each containing numerous sound events of di\ufb00erent categories, integrated into various acoustical spaces, captured from di\ufb00erent source directions and distances relative to the recording position. The spatialization of all sound events in the dataset is based on \ufb01ltering them through authentic spatial room impulse responses (RIRs) obtained from multiple rooms of varying shapes, sizes, and acoustical absorption properties. Moreover, each scene recording is categorized into two di\ufb00erent spatial recording formats, either microphone array (MIC) or \ufb01rst-order Ambisonics (FOA). The sound events are spatialized as either stationary sound sources in the room or moving sound sources, where time-variant RIRs are utilized. Each sound event present in the sound scene comes with a trajectory of its direction-of-arrival (DoA) towards the recording point, and a temporal onset and o\ufb00set time. This provides a comprehensive understanding of each sound event\\'s behavior over time and allows researchers to train robust models. Earality on Display Model Performance In order to demonstrate and test the model performance/accuracy before creating a prototype, we integrated some python scripts with the model which output the localization and classi\ufb01cation data in three-dimensions on a spherical plot using matplotlib. We provide some images of the test below. Figure 2: Model Performance AR Prototype (Blender) To prototype our AR application and try to implement some visuals of the residual concept, we decided to use blender. We will shift to ARKit/ARCode when developing the AR application during the MVP phase. Blender gave us the opportunity to exhibit Earality from a \ufb01rst-person perspective. Note that the wireframe sphere is not an actual depiction of what will appear in the AR application, but rather a substitute for the invisible spherical canvas upon which the visual cues will be shown. Of course, there are many other UI/UX considerations to be implemented when the actual application is developed. Here are some images of our prototype: Figure 3: Third Person View  Figure 4: First Person View  Future Scope Features There have been many features mentioned across all sections within this documentation. We\\'d like to clearly establish our goals for the MVP phase here. Ideally we would like to be able to e\ufb00ectively di\ufb00erentiate between speech and public announcements within our model. Once we overcome our goal of minimizing latency and \ufb01xing real-time inferencing issues, we will also be able to continuously store the last 10 seconds of data for rewinding and providing TTS (text-to-speech) on discernible speech. If time allows, we also aim to expand the model to accommodate more classes of sounds beyond the 14 we mentioned earlier. This would entail \ufb01nding or creating new spatial audio data upon which to train the SELDnet. Additionally, we maintain a stretch goal of adding music interpretation (HapticBeat) into Earality to work towards our goal of making an all-purpose application. Support Our related projects have received support from the Attack Theatre and Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. They have tested similar technology in the past and fully support projects in this \ufb01eld. They will be our \ufb01rst contacts when it comes to testing Earality in any format.

Moreover, there have been several research papers that report that mental health patients struggle to monitor their mental health status. The shortage of mental health professionals in the United States has also contributed to this problem. Many people who need help are unable to access it due to a lack of resources. Moreover, therapists are overworked and have difficulty engaging with patients, which is a major problem in providing effectivetreatment. One promising approach to improve mental health is the use of journaling and gratitude journaling. Regular gratitude journaling has been shown to result in several benefits, including better sleep quality, reduced stress, and enhanced self-awareness. However, patients often struggle with consistency and find it hard to reflect and show gratitude. Moreover, Gen Z, who make up a significant portion of the population, are more accustomed to using technology than writing things down in physical journals. One potential solution is to leverage technology to improvepatientengagementandtherapist-patientcommunication. Technology in helping patients to track their mental health progress has been used in the past, but was not successful as expected due to limitations on usability, effectiveness, and accessibility. These limitations include issues related to user engagement and adherence, the need for personalized approaches, and the need for more robust evaluation methodologies. The challenge, therefore, is to develop a platform that addresses these issues and empowers patients to take controloftheirmentalhealth. 3 Proposedsolution By using technology to enhance therapist-patient communication and improve engagement, we can make mental health services more accessible and effective for everyone. By creating a platform that allows therapists to access patient information before sessions, they can plan a course of treatment that is tailored to each patient\\'s needs. Moreover, by incorporating journaling and gratitude journaling into this platform, we can make it easier for patients to reflect and show gratitude,ultimatelyleadingtobettermentalhealthoutcomes. We aim to create a mobile application that covers the problems of patient progress tracking and patient-therapist disengagement. Therapeutrack is an application that supports patients throughout their treatment journey by allowing them to track their journey, and show gratitude. The app will utilize an Ai chatbot to gather information about a patient\\'s day in a conversational manner, which will then be converted into a posting similar to that of social media platforms. By this way, the patients can easily review and monitor their behavior and mental wellness in a familiar environment. Patients will also have the option to view their journals of any day in an intuitive manner. Therpeutrack will also ensure patients do the journals by giving constant reminders as well. The user will have the ability to add their therapist to the app to share their journals with them, thus enabling the therapist to tailor the sessions according to the information provided. Sometimes patients often also forget about events that happened to them throughout the week and Therapeutrack would ensure that vital information is not lost. The healing period in one\\'s mental health journey is long and the app will help therapists make the right decision with thedataavailable. 4 UseCase Jane is a college student who has been facing issues with depression and anxiety for the past 2 years. She visits her therapist once a week for her treatment. She is recommended by her therapist to write journals and keep a gratitude journal. She attempts to keep one but ends up slacking due to being busy and just forgetting. Her therapist recommends her to download Therapeutrack which enables her to interact with a chatbot to put in journal entries and look back towardsgoodmemories. 1. Janegetsanotificationtouploadapictureofwhatsheisgratefulfor. 2. Sheopenstheapplicationandthechatbotpromptshertouploadapicture. 3. After uploading the picture, the chatbot recognises the picture and steers a conversation talkingabouttheperson\\'sdayandwhattheyaregratefulfor. 4. This information is then put into a journal by the chatbot and a post will be created in the users\\'personalpagewiththecaptionbeingwhattheyaremostgratefulfor. 5. All this information can be easily viewed by Jane to go through when she\\'s having a toughdaytoseeallthememoriesandthingsthatshe\\'sgratefulfor. 6. The therapist can also view the journal before the session to get an overview of how Jane isdoingandplanhersessionaccordingly. 5 Technology ApplicationofArtificialIntelligence 1.ConversationalAgent Description The chatbot has the capability to converse with patients in a human-like manner. The chatbot is provided with capabilities to collect mental health status of a patient through therapy-oriented generative questions and generate summarization of the conversation regarding the mental health status which can be readily viewed and tracked by the patients and the therapists, and the text summarization will be used to generate a post for future health tracking. The purpose of the chatbot is to subside the effect of clinician-patient disengagement by providing fundamental therapeuticadviceandgivesummarizedupdatestothepatient\\'stherapists. Approach a.Prototypephase In the prototype phase, we focus mostly on training the chatbot to have basic conversation with patients asking about their mental health on a daily basis. Using the pipeline API provided from HuggingFace, we implemented two language models for our prototype phase: openai/gpt as our conversationalagent. 6  Though the chatbot can converse with the patient very naturally, its response is conditional. In the prototype, the chatbot classifies the emotion of the patient and responds conditionally. For instance, if the response is positive, the chatbot will generate compliment texts, and encouraging text otherwise. Though implemented with very high accuracy of response and sentiment analysis, this implementation of the chatbot is not very helpful in general cases when the sentiment is ambiguous,limitingthecapabilityofprovidingtherapeuticadvicefordifferentpatients. b.MVP phase To create a chatbot as human-like as possible and is able to generate most appropriate responses to general cases, we implement a Transfer Learning approach on top of Pretrained Large Language Models with the integration of other image classification models due to the defined capability of the chatbot. Machines need to be trained on a very large corpus of text to be able to generate long stretches of contiguous coherent texts. This requires tremendous machine power and time to create such a Language Model. Therefore, the procedure for training such a chat bot isasfollow: -ImplementthearchitectureandweightsofaaveryLargeLanguageModel -Fine-tunetheLanguageModeltoadaptittoourendtask:Therapeuticchatbot Our criteria is to develop a human-like conversational chatbot, so the chosen Language Model has to be very large, to be more specific the bigger the better. With that said, the candidate Natural Language Processing models are: openai/gpt, pygmalionAI/pygmalion-6b, BERT. These 7  models are all open-sourced and can be re-modeled on HuggingFace - an AI community. Moreover, these models follow the Transformer architecture that provide the capability to generate context-focused texts. This is due to a type of component in the model called Attention layers that help the machine to generate the next words in the sequences with regard to the context. To modify the behavior of the chatbot from open-domain to therapeutic purposes, we will be fine-tuning the weights of the predefined model using the nbertagnolli/counsel_chat. This dataset is collected from online conversations between therapists and patients on counselchat.com. To start training the model on a new dataset, we have to convert the data format for the HuggingFace models. Since the conversation is in a dialog format and the chatbot generates responses based on the the patient\\'s inputs, the chatbot will use several types of context to generateanoutputsequence: -Personalizedinformationofpatients -Historyconversationwiththepatientswithatleastthelastutterance -Thetokensofoutputtedsequencewhichwillbeusedtogeneratetokens [ 2 ] 8  2.Dialogsummarization Description One of the functionalities of the application is to provide the clients both the patients and the therapists a precise, clinically informative summarization of appropriate length. This helps the patients quickly track and monitor their mental health status over a period of time easily. Also, therapists will benefit from acquiring the informative mental health of a large number of patients efficiently and precisely indicating appropriate clinical information. This functionality aims to help patients and therapists to acquire accurate and concise information readily, reducing the heavymanualworkloadofreviewinglargepastcorpura. Approach a.Prototypephase We implemented the pre-trained summarization model philschmid/flan-t5-based-samsum on HugginFace. This model has been trained on the dataset samsum which provides sets of pair sequences - dialog and summarization of the dialog. The input will be the entire conversation betweenthepatientandthechatbot. b.MVP phase The summarization model - philschmid/flan-t5-based-samsum - will be fine-tuned so that summarized text will be in first person addressing. This is due to the nature and purpose of bullet journal entries as a mental health tracker. For the instance above, Anne, third-person addressing, will be changed to first-person pronouns. The training dataset for the model will be modified and reloaded into the model. Specifically, the summarized text in the training data will be all convertedtofirst-personaddressing. To allow the clinicians to glimpse important information efficiently to derive quick and accurate medical counseling, the summarization application needs to be able to segment the dialogs and summarize them into essential psychotherapy elements. A dialog might be segmented into sectionssuchasthis: 9 [ 3 ] We will use the pre-trained summarization model used in the prototype phase as a training base for the fine-tuned model which has the capability to summarize the dialog based on the mental health domain knowledge. To maintain a high accuracy of summarized text, we will reuse the approach of Transfer Learning on pre-trained models. The dataset we will be using to fine-tune the model is MentSum, A summarization corpus for exploring summarization of mental health posts, gathered from 43 mental health-related subreddits. We will also be re-training other summarizationmodelsuchasDistillBertforevaluationofaccuracybetweentwomodels As OpenAI has released the API for using ChatGPT, we are open to explore and research on the implementation of ChatGPT and other models. To ensure patients private information, we have to make sure ChatGPT will not be collecting users\\' data. Moreover, as our application focuses on the mental health domain and ChatGPT is an open-domain language model, we will need to fine-tuneitforourdesiredpurposes. 10  TherapeutrackMobileapp Description One of the reasons we decide to make Theraputrack into a mobile application is to make it easily accessibleforalotofpeople.Theappwillalsoincludeseveraladvantages,suchas: \u00b7 Easeofaccesstocorefeatures \u00b7 Crossplatform \u00b7 LightweightandfastusingDart \u00b7 ScalablewithlargerdatasetsthroughAWSAmplify Our choice for the mobile frontend framework is Flutter, which utilizes the Dart programming language.

Therapeutrackcloudbasedplatformandmachinelearning Therapeutrack employs TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine learning, to construct diverse deep learning models for its solution. AWS and its array of features will be utilized, with AWS Amplify serving as the primary backend for the MVP phase. Amplify offers fundamental features such as authentication, push notifications, scalability, and deployment, all essentialtotheapplication\\'sfunctionality. 11 User interface Therapeutrack is developed as a mobile application to give the patients the highest accessibility to monitoring their mental health status.. For therapists to tailor their treatments towards patients, they have to thoroughly understand the mental health status of each; after consulting with professional therapists, one valuable source of information that therapists used to track their patients\\' mental health status is through their journaling.

Demonstrationofuse-casescenario 12  DataSource counsel_chatdataset The therapist-like behavior conversations are provided by counselchat.com. This is a platform to help counselors build their reputation and make meaningful contact with potential clients. On the site, therapists respond to questions posed by clients, and users can like responses that they find most helpful.

The dataset will be translated into the appropriate format for each testing model on HuggingFace. To extract the dataset format, HuggingFace provided a Dataset module on Python to download and view the data format for each specified model. Moreover, HuggingFace also providesanAPImodulefortokenizingandencodingthesequencesinputtingintothemodels. MentSumdataset MentSum is a summarization corpus for exploring summarization of mental health posts, gathered from 43 mental health-related subreddits, obtaining over 24k carefully selected user posts from Reddit, along with their short user-written summary (TLDR) in English. With that said, the dataset is formatted with two essential tags: the dialog and its summarization in the TLDR format. This dataset format is similar to that of the suggested model on HugginFace, so we only need to pipeline the dataset precisely into the model using appropriate API calls and data storage methods. MentSum is an open-source dataset for training mental health summarization tasks, but it is a sensitive dataset so we need to apply for usage through a data request form from theauthors. 13 Futurescope HIPAACompliance WewillbeensuringtheappisHIPAAcomplianttoprotectsensitivepatientdata.Tomakeour appHIPAAcompliant(whichisimportantwhendealingwithhealthinformation),we\\'retaking severalsteps.We\\'recheckingtheappforpotentialsecurityrisks,addingsecurityfeatureslike encryptionandaccesscontrols,creatingpoliciesforhowhealthinformationisusedandshared. Thisway,wecanmakesureourusers\\'healthinformationiskeptsafeandprivate. Enhancinguserengagement As the quality of mental health treatments depends significantly upon the well-being progress of the patients, it is essential to create a well-structured plan and features for enhancing user engagement with the applications. The application will send out notifications of reminders for patients to document their mental health status to maximize client-engagement with the application. Furthermore, we will be consulting with professional therapists which we have contacted to understand about the barriers and limitations of traditional journaling methods and use technology to solve those problems. For our first beta-testing round, we will be collecting dataontheuserexperience(therapistsandpatients)onthefeedbackoftheapplications Recommendationsystem: For future updated features, the chatbot can suggest mental health enhanced activities personalized to the patients. After prolonged use of the application, the model will have a sufficient amount of data for each patient such as their favorite activities, hobbies. With these datasets, the chatbot can suggest favorable activities that might help the patients in developing their mental health. This feature can be developed based on the sentiment association with any activities that involve positivity through past conversations with the chatbot. Using the hybrid model of Transformer and SVM, KNN algorithms the chatbot can classify the actions that involvepositiveandnegativeemotions. 14 Developmenttimeline TeamCapabilities HoangBui AthirdyearstudentdoublingmajorinComputerScienceand Mathematics.HestronglybelievesthatAI/MLwillbethe drivingforceforadvances.Hehasexperienceindeveloping DeepLearningmodels,andcurrentlyholdsaresearch assistantpositionforanNLP-basedproject.For Therapeutrack,hewillbeinchargeofdataprocessing, developingandmaintainingtheMLmodelsforthe monitoringtoolsandAIchatbot.

When I first started at Penn State, transferring credits was a pain and took more than a year.  , I am not certain as to the impact this tool will have.  While I recognize the fact that the handling of transfer credits is a tedious and labor-intensive process, I also recognize that there are so many cases where just one thing could require a human in the loop and I suspect in general, a human is going to have to be in the loop more often then not.  Will it speed up some aspects of the process?  Perhaps., limited audience and use case , Very interesting idea ! It would have been more impactful to get actual testimonials from fauclty members or students at penn State, Have you done a thorough competitive analysis for your application? Have you taken your concept to your intended consumer to gather key input on the design and functionality? How will the application address changes made to entrance requirements by each individual major being selected? Since a transcript is only one part of the admissions process, how will this be easily streamlined with the other steps taken before acceptance occurs? Have you created a financial model for your project which includes a break-even analysis? [Overall feedback included here.]\nFeasibility - Comments: definitely feasible product.  \nImplementation & Scaling - Comments: will such a capable team, scaling and implementation should not be a problem, I am also deeply skeptical that this tool can work to support other institutions.  As someone who works in this space currently comparing how PSU does work to other institutions - it is a huge problem to which there is no easy plug and play solution., I can see that the app can be scaled to help faculty/students in universities across the country . Again it would be helpful to have testimonials from the targeted audience\nTeam Capabilities - Comments: the team is very capable of creating an MVP\nTechnical Sophistication - Comments: Good explanation of the technical approach . The flowcharts/diagrams aid in visual representation of the technology stack.\nUse of AI & ML Technologies - Comments: \nUse of Available Data - Comments: Good explanation of the data sources. Is there any alternative for the testing data other than Open Syllabus? This will be critical to improve accuracy of your model.\nInterface Design Plans/Consumability - Comments: interface design could use some improvements, but overall an excellent job, UI design looks simple and neat. It would have been nice to see a statistic on the number of faculty members / students  who would be interested to use this tool or from people the team intends  to get feedback from?\nTotal: 51.199999999999996"}

Would a significant number of people be interested in finding out (especially since I would have to also buy hardware)? Unsure, this might be a niche market of consumers., this has huge implications for all parts of the world, network connectivity in developing countries could be an issue.  Can you store the data and then upload once network connectivity is available , The prototype is impactful and has great potential to help people in rural areas., Have you done a thorough competitive analysis for your application? What other applications have been developed in an effort to address this issue? Have you taken your concept to your intended consumer to gather key input on the design and functionality? Have you considered that a big hurdle in this population is accessibility and technology competence as most areas that have water quality and accessibility concerns also have limited resources and accessibility to technology. How do you plan to engage individuals to join the community you are trying to create with these limitations? Have you created a financial model for your project which includes a break-even analysis? [Overall feedback included here.]\nFeasibility - Comments: anything that uses a hardware component will be a challenge to develop, I think the team should be wary of labelling data as based on the size of the dataset , it can take a good chunk of your time.\nImplementation & Scaling - Comments: implementation and scalability will be a problem due to hardware used to support the application, The solution can be of great help to many people across the globe. I love the idea of creating a community on the app . This can also connect people around the locality.\nTeam Capabilities - Comments: while the team has some strengths, particularly data science, program, AI/ML\nTechnical Sophistication - Comments: Technical approach was explained very well.\nUse of AI & ML Technologies - Comments: \nUse of Available Data - Comments: \nInterface Design Plans/Consumability - Comments: UI design is nice . The team could have done a better job explaining the MVP pipeline in depth.\nTotal: 45.8"}
